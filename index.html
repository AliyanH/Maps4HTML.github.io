      <h2>About the Community Group</h2>
      <p>
        The Maps for HTML community group is working to standardize
        methods of defining interactive geographic maps for websites.
        The community group is hosted by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium),
        and is open to anyone who is interested in maps and web standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information, consult:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/">Maps for HTML Community Group homepage on w3.org</a>
          <p>
            Includes a blog (infrequently updated),
            along with other information such as
            links to the group's draft reports,
            links to the group's mailing list, social media, and forums,
            and lists of current participants and chairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly of all,
            <em>this is where you join the group!</em>
            Look for the “Get involved” heading
            and the “Join this group” link.
            You'll need to create a W3C website account,
            and accept the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community Contributor License Agreement</a>.
            If you have an employer with rights to work you create,
            they may need to join on your behalf.

      <h2>Specifications and Reports</h2>
      <p>
        The group is currently working on three reports
        (which are all drafts and subject to change):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://maps4html.github.io/HTML-Map-Element-UseCases-Requirements/">HTML map element: Use Cases and Requirements</a>
          (<a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/HTML-Map-Element-UseCases-Requirements">GitHub repository</a>)
          <p>
            An overview of why HTML needs a built-in map viewer element,
            which can combine multiple layers into an interactive view.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            An explainer of the 
            <a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/MapML-Proposal#the-mapml-proposal---explainermd">MapML proposal</a>.  
            The explainer is based on a <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers">template</a> 
            recommended by the W3C TAG, and may be the best place to start in 
            trying to understand the substance of the MapML proposal.  The 
            "MapML Proposal" relates to the following two proposed specifications,
            which are slightly out of date and need to be revised.  GitHub
            issues in the explainer repository can be used to identify problems.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://maps4html.github.io/HTML-Map-Element/spec/">HTML map element specification</a>
          (<a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/HTML-Map-Element">GitHub repository</a>)
          <p>
            A proposal for how the HTML map viewer and layer elements could be defined.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://maps4html.github.io/MapML/spec/">MapML specification</a>
          (<a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/MapML">GitHub repository</a>)
          <p>
            A proposal for a new document format for describing maps (MapML),
            which could contain a mix of tiled images,
            vector features (e.g., points, lines, polygons),
            and hyperlinks to related resources.
            MapML documents could be used as layers in an HTML map viewer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/2019/12/09/the-design-of-mapml/">blog post</a>, detailing how the MapML proposal relates to the 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/">HTML Design Principles</a>.</li>

      <h2>Software projects</h2>
      <p>
        The following projects
        (hosted by the community group's GitHub account)
        make it possible to experiment with the proposed specifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/Web-Map-Custom-Element">Web-map custom element</a>
          <p>
            A polyfill of the proposed HTML map / layer element specification,
            with MapML support, as a set of HTML custom elements,  using Leaflet
            as the map rendering engine.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/geoserver">GeoServer MapML MapML Community Module</a>
          <p>
            A GeoServer module that enables MapML output, supporting images, 
            features and tiles. There is basic 
            <a href="https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/mapml/index.html">documentation</a> 
            available, as well as

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/">OGC® Standards and Supporting Documents</a>
          <p>
            The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) publishes standards for map-related data,
            many of which are used or adapted for MapML.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/17-019.html">MapML Engineering Report (2017)</a> from the <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> Testbed 13
          <p>
            Reviews the MapML spec (as it was at the time)
            and experimental implementations for serving and using MapML documents.
            Some of the recommendations have since been integrated in the specification,
            or otherwise made redundant.
            A follow-up report will be published as part of OGC Testbed 14.
